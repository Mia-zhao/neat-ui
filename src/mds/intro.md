# Introduction

Neat UI is a UI component library based on Vue 3 and TypeScript. This library currently supports [Button](#/doc/button), [Switch](#/doc/switch), [Tabs](#/doc/tabs), [Menu](#/doc/menu), [Modal](#/doc/modal), and [Carousel](#/doc/carousel) components.

Neat UI component library is created independenty by myself, with my best effort to not use any third libraries.

This product website is developed independently as well.
